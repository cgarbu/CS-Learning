## 22.1 Smart pointers

A Smart pointer is a composition class that is designed to manage dynamically allocated memory and ensure that memory gets deleted when the smart pointer object goes out of scope. (Relatedly, built-in pointers are sometimes called “dumb pointers” because they can’t clean up after themselves).

A shallow copy in C++ duplicates an object by making a member-wise copy of its fields. If the class contains basic types (like int or float), their actual values are copied. However, if the class contains pointers to dynamically allocated memory, a shallow copy only copies the memory addresses (pointers) rather than the actual data on the heap. 

What if, instead of having our copy constructor and assignment operator copy the pointer (“copy semantics”), we instead transfer/move ownership of the pointer from the source to the destination object? This is the core idea behind move semantics. Move semantics means the class will transfer ownership of the object rather than making a copy.

Here's an example:
```c++
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Auto_ptr2
{
	T* m_ptr {};
public:
	Auto_ptr2(T* ptr=nullptr)
		:m_ptr(ptr)
	{
	}

	~Auto_ptr2()
	{
		delete m_ptr;
	}

	// A copy constructor that implements move semantics
	Auto_ptr2(Auto_ptr2& a) // note: not const
	{
		// We don't need to delete m_ptr here.  This constructor is only called when we're creating a new object, and m_ptr can't be set prior to this.
		m_ptr = a.m_ptr; // transfer our dumb pointer from the source to our local object
		a.m_ptr = nullptr; // make sure the source no longer owns the pointer
	}

	// An assignment operator that implements move semantics
	Auto_ptr2& operator=(Auto_ptr2& a) // note: not const
	{
		if (&a == this)
			return *this;

		delete m_ptr; // make sure we deallocate any pointer the destination is already holding first
		m_ptr = a.m_ptr; // then transfer our dumb pointer from the source to the local object
		a.m_ptr = nullptr; // make sure the source no longer owns the pointer
		return *this;
	}

	T& operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
	T* operator->() const { return m_ptr; }
	bool isNull() const { return m_ptr == nullptr; }
};

class Resource
{
public:
	Resource() { std::cout << "Resource acquired\n"; }
	~Resource() { std::cout << "Resource destroyed\n"; }
};

int main()
{
	Auto_ptr2<Resource> res1(new Resource());
	Auto_ptr2<Resource> res2; // Start as nullptr

	std::cout << "res1 is " << (res1.isNull() ? "null\n" : "not null\n");
	std::cout << "res2 is " << (res2.isNull() ? "null\n" : "not null\n");

	res2 = res1; // res2 assumes ownership, res1 is set to null

	std::cout << "Ownership transferred\n";

	std::cout << "res1 is " << (res1.isNull() ? "null\n" : "not null\n");
	std::cout << "res2 is " << (res2.isNull() ? "null\n" : "not null\n");

	return 0;
}
```


## 22.2 R-value references

C++11 adds a new type of reference called an r-value reference. An r-value reference is a reference that is designed to be initialized with an r-value (only). While an l-value reference is created using a single ampersand, an r-value reference is created using a double ampersand:
```c++
int x{ 5 };
int& lref{ x }; // l-value reference initialized with l-value x
int&& rref{ 5 }; // r-value reference initialized with r-value 5
```

Rvalue reference variables are lvalues.

You should almost never return an r-value reference, for the same reason you should almost never return an l-value reference. In most cases, you’ll end up returning a hanging reference when the referenced object goes out of scope at the end of the function.


## 22.3 Move constructors and move assignment

Copy constructors are used to initialize a class by making a copy of an object of the same class. Copy assignment is used to copy one class object to another existing class object. By default, C++ will provide a copy constructor and copy assignment operator if one is not explicitly provided. These compiler-provided functions do shallow copies, which may cause problems for classes that allocate dynamic memory. So classes that deal with dynamic memory should override these functions to do deep copies.

Defining a move constructor and move assignment work analogously to their copy counterparts. However, whereas the copy flavors of these functions take a const l-value reference parameter (which will bind to just about anything), the move flavors of these functions use non-const rvalue reference parameters (which only bind to rvalues).

An example:
```c++
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
class Auto_ptr4
{
	T* m_ptr {};
public:
	Auto_ptr4(T* ptr = nullptr)
		: m_ptr { ptr }
	{
	}

	~Auto_ptr4()
	{
		delete m_ptr;
	}

	// Copy constructor
	// Do deep copy of a.m_ptr to m_ptr
	Auto_ptr4(const Auto_ptr4& a)
	{
		m_ptr = new T;
		*m_ptr = *a.m_ptr;
	}

	// Move constructor
	// Transfer ownership of a.m_ptr to m_ptr
	Auto_ptr4(Auto_ptr4&& a) noexcept
		: m_ptr { a.m_ptr }
	{
		a.m_ptr = nullptr; // we'll talk more about this line below
	}

	// Copy assignment
	// Do deep copy of a.m_ptr to m_ptr
	Auto_ptr4& operator=(const Auto_ptr4& a)
	{
		// Self-assignment detection
		if (&a == this)
			return *this;

		// Release any resource we're holding
		delete m_ptr;

		// Copy the resource
		m_ptr = new T;
		*m_ptr = *a.m_ptr;

		return *this;
	}

	// Move assignment
	// Transfer ownership of a.m_ptr to m_ptr
	Auto_ptr4& operator=(Auto_ptr4&& a) noexcept
	{
		// Self-assignment detection
		if (&a == this)
			return *this;

		// Release any resource we're holding
		delete m_ptr;

		// Transfer ownership of a.m_ptr to m_ptr
		m_ptr = a.m_ptr;
		a.m_ptr = nullptr; // we'll talk more about this line below

		return *this;
	}

	T& operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
	T* operator->() const { return m_ptr; }
	bool isNull() const { return m_ptr == nullptr; }
};

class Resource
{
public:
	Resource() { std::cout << "Resource acquired\n"; }
	~Resource() { std::cout << "Resource destroyed\n"; }
};

Auto_ptr4<Resource> generateResource()
{
	Auto_ptr4<Resource> res{new Resource};
	return res; // this return value will invoke the move constructor
}

int main()
{
	Auto_ptr4<Resource> mainres;
	mainres = generateResource(); // this assignment will invoke the move assignment

	return 0;
}
```

The move constructor and move assignment are called when those functions have been defined, and the argument for construction or assignment is an rvalue. Most typically, this rvalue will be a literal or temporary value.

The copy constructor and copy assignment are used otherwise (when the argument is an lvalue, or when the argument is an rvalue and the move constructor or move assignment functions aren’t defined).

The compiler will create an implicit move constructor and move assignment operator if all of the following are true:
* There are no user-declared copy constructors or copy assignment operators.
* There are no user-declared move constructors or move assignment operators.
* There is no user-declared destructor.
These functions do a memberwise move, which behaves as follows:
* If member has a move constructor or move assignment (as appropriate), it will be invoked.
* Otherwise, the member will be copied.
Notably, this means that pointers will be copied, not moved!

If we construct an object or do an assignment where the argument is an l-value, the only thing we can reasonably do is copy the l-value. We can’t assume it’s safe to alter the l-value, because it may be used again later in the program. If we have an expression “a = b” (where b is an lvalue), we wouldn’t reasonably expect b to be changed.

However, if we construct an object or do an assignment where the argument is an r-value, then we know that r-value is just a temporary object of some kind. Instead of copying it (which can be expensive), we can simply transfer its resources (which is cheap) to the object we’re constructing or assigning. This is safe to do because the temporary will be destroyed at the end of the expression anyway, so we know it will never be used again!

Move semantics is an optimization opportunity.

Move functions should always leave both objects in a valid state. In the above example, both the move constructor and move assignment functions set a.m_ptr to nullptr.

Automatic l-values returned by value may be moved instead of copied.

You can delete the move constructor and move assignment using the = delete syntax in the exact same way you can delete the copy constructor and copy assignment.
